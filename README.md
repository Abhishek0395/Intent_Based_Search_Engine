# Intent_Based_Search_Engine
This project implements a semantic product search engine that intelligently understands user intent and retrieves the most relevant products from a FAISS-based vector store.
We developed an AI-Powered Intent-Based Product Search System ‚Äì a cutting-edge solution that goes beyond traditional keyword search to understand user intent through semantic search, multilingual NLP, and Large Language Models (LLMs).
üîç Project Highlights:
 1. Intent-driven, multilingual semantic search engine
 2. Workflow orchestration and auto fine-tuning of LLMs using Airflow
 3. Input & Output Guardrails for safety and responsible AI use
 4. Optimized for constraints: 20 t3.medium VMs, 3GB GPU, S3 storage 
 5. Redis caching to reduce latency & boost performance
 6. monitoring system with Prometheus, Grafana,Loki, Jaeger, LangSmith
 7. Fully deployed on AWS with production-level architecture
